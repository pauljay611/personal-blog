## What's Docker?

Before introduce Laradock, let's explain what's Docker. Docker is a software platform let you build, test, deploy your container rapidly. 
Maybe you have tried to use VM to build your server. We can imagine that the container is an environment. This environment include your operation system, library, and everything you need to build your application. 

##ã€€Container vs VM

> VM:

1. Need to install operation system
2. Spent much time to start server
3. Isolate the hardware sources
4. Occupy more disk storage

> Docker: 

1. Pull and use operation image from docker hub directly
2. No need to start server
3. Use operation kernel in bottom layer
4. Less storage used

## Start install Docker

Let's install Docker in ubuntu

1. sudo apt-get install docker.io // install docker by apt get

2. service docker status // see docker status

3. docker version // see docker version

## Commands for docker

Commands that you will use frequently in docker

1. docker run -it {container} bash // start container enivonment

2. docker exec $(container) /bin/bash // enter container

3. docker ps // see all containers you have

4. docker stop/restart/pause  DOCKER_ID // stop/restart/pause container

**The above is for one container operation. If we want to operate in multiple container, you need to use Docker Compose**

5. https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ // install docker compose in different OS

6. docker-compose up -d nginx mysql // start multiple containers

7. docker-compose exec workspace bash // enter containers

8. docker-compose down // stop containers

# Laradock

Let's move on our topic. Laradock!!

## What's Laradock

Laradock is used by docker + laravel framework. Includes pre-packaged Docker Images, all pre-configured to provide a wonderful PHP development environment and it started supporting other PHP projects like Symfony, CodeIgniter, WordPress, Drupal...

## Install Laradock

If you haven't had a laravel project, you need to clone laradock respository to build the docker environment

1. mkdir ~/projects // create a folder to save our laravel project

2. git clone https://github.com/Laradock/laradock.git 

3. cd laradock  cp env-example .env // enter laradock folder and config your .env variable

4. vim .env // change your path to APP_CODE_PATH_HOST=../projects

5. docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin redis workspace // start multiple container in laradock which laravel needed

6. docker-compose exec workspace bash // enter your containers

7. composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog // create new laravel project

8. chmod 777 -R storage // overwrite the storage auth 

9. exit and vim ~/laradock/nginx/sites/default.conf // change root from /var/www/public; to /var/www/blog/public;

**Enter http://localhost to see your laravel website in docker**

If you have laravel project, just Clone laradock on your project root directory

1. git submodule add https://github.com/Laradock/laradock.git
